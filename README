this program can be used to rip your synthesizer's sound:
it plays configured notes and records the result.

have a look at the files under example-drums and example-instruments
for the syntax

for switching between instrument and drum mode, you must edit
midirip.c and set/unset the #define DRUM_MODE!

Disclaimer: this program has been written in a great hurry,
            within less than ~5 hours of pure coding!
	    Expect appropriate buggyness.
